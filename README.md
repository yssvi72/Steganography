# Steganography- cybersecurity project
Steganography hides secret data in plain sight, enhancing security. It combines with encryption for added protection. The term originates from Greek: "stegos"(hidden) + "graph" (writing).Steganography possesses the capability to discreetly mask a wide array of digital content, encompassing text, images, videos, or audio elements. The data intended for concealment can be effectively inserted within various forms of digital content. Referred to as "hidden text," this content is frequently subjected to encryption prior to its integration into seemingly benign cover text files or data streams. In instances where encryption is omitted, the hidden text often undergoes specific alterations to heighten the challenge of uncovering the confidential material.
Here are the key features of the encoding/decoding process for hiding text within an image:
1) Encoding/Decoding Option: Users can select either the "encode" or "decode" option, depending on whether they want to hide a message within an image or retrieve a 
   hidden message from an image.
2) Image Selection: For the "encode" option, users can click on the "select" button to upload the image in which they wish to hide the text. For the "decode" option, 
   users need to choose the image they want to decrypt.
3) Message Hiding: When choosing the "encode" option, users can enter the message they want to conceal within the image. Upon entering the message, they can click on 
   "cancel" to exit the input.
4) Message Retrieval: If the "decode" option is selected, users need to "select" the image containing the hidden message. Once the image is uploaded, the concealed 
   message will be displayed. Clicking on "cancel" will exit this process.

These features provide a straightforward and user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding messages within images. Users have the flexibility to hide and retrieve messages securely, enhancing the privacy of their communications.
